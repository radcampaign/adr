# 2. Host ADRs on Github

Date: 2023-04-21

## Status

Proposed

## Context

ADRs should be lightweight and accessible. We want to minimize effort to
create, discuss, and access ADRs to maximize their usefulness.

## Decision

We will host ADRs on Github in this repository.

## Consequences

- ADRs will be accessible in an interface familiar to most if not all
  team members.
- ADRs will only be officially-updateable by team members with write
  access to this repository.
