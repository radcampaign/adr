# 5. Propose new ADRs as pull requests

Date: 2023-04-21

## Status

Proposed

## Context

ADRs should be discussed transparently and with accountability. Familiar
tools make it more likely for all to participate. Closely associating
discussion with the concrete manifestation of the ADRs provides more
context.

## Decision

We will propose new ADRs by creating pull requests against this repo,
and will use those pull requests to host discussion and feedback on the
proposed ADR.

## Consequences

- ADRs will have a history of authorship and some history of discussion.
- The history of discussion might be incomplete if some of it happens
  elsewhere (Slack, Zoom, IRL???).
