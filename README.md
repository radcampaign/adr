# Rad Campaign's Architecture Decision Records

This is a repository of architecture decision records (ADRs) agreed
upon by Rad Campaign's development team.

An architecture decision record is a short text file that captures a
single decision made about the architecture of a software system. It is
a record of the decision, not a record of the discussion that led to the
decision. It should be brief, clear, and describe the forces that
influenced the decision and the consequences of adopting it.

We have adopted [Michael
Nygard's](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions)
format for ADRs, as specified by [`adr-tools`](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
