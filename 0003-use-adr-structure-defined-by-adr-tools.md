# 3. Use ADR structure defined by `adr-tools`

Date: 2023-04-21

## Status

Proposed

## Context

ADRs are a formal device, and require a regular structure. Any tools
that can automate that structure will make it easier for any team member
to contribute ADRs while following that structure.

## Decision

The ADRs in this repo will be structured as specified by the
[`adr-tools`](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) scripts, and team
members are encouraged to
[install](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
and [use](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools/blob/master/README.md) the
scripts to contribute new ADRs.

## Consequences

- ADRs will have a consistent structure.
- Team members will have an automated way to produce ADRs consistent
  with the agreed-upon structure.
- Team members will need to either use the `adr-tools` scripts or
  manually reproduce the ADR structure.
