# 6. README is required

Date: 2024-03-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Multiple developers may work on a project, colleagues come and go, and
knowledge about how to set up and develop a project needs to be
documented.

## Decision

Each project should have at least a root-directory README.md file.

## Consequences

Decisions and instructions about individual projects will be accessible
by all developers. Devs with intimate knowledge of a project will need
to maintain that project's documentation.
